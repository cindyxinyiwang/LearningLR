\section{\label{sec:conclusion}Conclusion}
We present Differentiable Data Selection, an automatic data selection framework for optimizing data usage of deep learning models. Our method does not require domain knowledge for heuristic design, and instead directly optimizes the training data distribution along with the main model. We formulate two algorithms under the DDS framework for both multilingual NMT and image classification, which lead to consistent improvement over strong baselines.
