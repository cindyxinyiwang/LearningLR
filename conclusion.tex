\section{\label{sec:conclusion}Conclusion}
We present \emph{differentiable data selection}, an efficient RL framework for optimizing training data usage. We parameterize the scorer network as a differentiable function of the data, and provide an intuitive reward function for efficiently training the scorer network. We formulate two algorithms under the \dds~framework for two realistic and very different tasks, image classification and multilingual NMT, which lead to consistent improvements over strong baselines.
