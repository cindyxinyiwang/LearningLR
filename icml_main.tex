%%%%%%%% ICML 2019 EXAMPLE LATEX SUBMISSION FILE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\documentclass{article}

% Recommended, but optional, packages for figures and better typesetting:
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{booktabs} % for professional tables

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2019} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2019} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}
\newcommand{\dds}{DDS}

%\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % allow utf-8 input
%\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}    % use 8-bit T1 fonts
%\usepackage{nicefrac}       % compact symbols for 1/2, etc.
%\usepackage[normalem]{ulem}

\usepackage[linesnumbered,ruled]{algorithm2e}
\usepackage{adjustbox}
\usepackage{mathtools}
% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
\usepackage{icml2019}
\usepackage{wrapfig}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
%\usepackage[accepted]{icml2019}

% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.
% Therefore, a short form for the running title is supplied here:
\icmltitlerunning{Optimizing Data Usage via Differentiable Rewards}
%\input{defs}

\icmltitle{Optimizing Data Usage via Differentiable Rewards}

% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2019
% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019. Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
